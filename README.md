# IMDB-Clone-CN
<br>

This IMDb clone utilizes the OMDB API to fetch movie data. The project consists of three HTML files (index.html, movies.html, favorites.html) and asynchronous JavaScript functions for data retrieval. The main page showcases a movie list, the details page displays individual movie information, and the favorites page stores selected movies.<br>
The favourites page is implemented in a such way that the movie list is persistent i.e you can close and reopen or refresh the browser and your favourite movies will remain intact.<br>
User friendly, easy and effective implementation of IMDB.
